## Image Interlacer

The Image Interlacer code combines two images to form a lenticular image. The user can select how many pixels should be grouped together in each column. This must be a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...). 

Examples of images created by this software can be found in the output_examples folder. There are also two examples below.
